# Weather Trend Forecasting

## PMA Mission
By making industry-leading tools and education available to individuals from all backgrounds, we level the playing field for future PM leaders. This is the PM Accelerator motto, as we grant aspiring and experienced PMs what they need most – Access. We introduce you to industry leaders, surround you with the right PM ecosystem, and discover the new world of AI product management skills.

## Project Overview
This project analyzes historical weather data to forecast temperature trends using Python and machine learning.

## Files
- `https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/global-weather-repository/code` – Original dataset
- `Basic_Assessment, Advance_Assessment` – Jupyter notebooks for analysis and forecasting
- `WEATHER_FORECASTING.docx` – Detailed report with methodology, results, and discussion

## Methodology
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
3. Model training and forecasting
4. Evaluation of predictions

## Results
- Line plots showing actual vs. predicted temperatures
- Model performance metrics
- Observed trends and insights

## How to Run
